    "Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "- Any relevant data sets should be available on Canvas. To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Here is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.  I also recommend the [wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) for LaTex.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do **Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All** as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- 45 points of this assignment are in problems.  The remaining 5 are for neatness, style, and overall exposition of both code and text.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",
    "- There is *not a prescribed API* for these problems.  You may answer coding questions with whatever syntax or object typing you deem fit.  Your evaluation will primarily live in the clarity of how well you present your final results, so don't skip over any interpretations!  Your code should still be commented and readable to ensure you followed the given course algorithm.\n",
    "- There are two ways to quickly make a .pdf out of this notebook for Gradescope submission.  Either:\n",
    " - Use File -> Download as PDF via LaTeX.  This will require your system path find a working install of a TeX compiler\n",
    " - Easier: Use File ->  Print Preview, and then Right-Click -> Print using your default browser and \"Print to PDF\"\n",

One narrative that is often discussed in the NFL playoffs is whether or not overtime - the way games tied after 4 quarters are handled -  is *fair*.  The general rules of an NFL overtime are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The teams alternate who gets the ball to try to score.  The team that wins the coin toss gets to try first.\n",
    "- The game is over whenever a team scores, and that team is the winner.  There are two exceptions to this rule, listed in the next bullet point.\n",
    "- If the first team (Team 0) scores a \"Field Goal,\" the other team has a chance to get the ball.  In this case, if the other team (Team 1) scores a \"Touchdown\" they win, if Team 1 scores a \"Field Goal,\" the game continues but reverts to next-score-wins, and if Team 1 failes to score they lose.\n",
    "- The game ends at a tie (in the regular season) if neither team scores at all within 10 minutes.  The game is also a tie if they each scored Field Goals in their first drives and then no scores followed in an overall duration of 10 minutes.  It's also possible for Team 0 to win by scoring a Field Goal and having the clock run out during Team 1's subsequent drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to *simulate* NFL overtimes to determine whether or not they're fair!  Note that in theory this **should** be a similar to problem 1: if $p=q=.5$ in the dueling problem, you should be able to quickly compute that both Dale and Brennan would be equally likely to win.  But the NFL rules are a little different, and not every scenario involves both teams getting an equal number of chances...\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate NFL overtimes, we're going to simulate **drives** of each team.  These is the outcomes of each of their turns to have the ball.  In particular, we'll assume each and every drive follows the (simplified) probabilities given by the approximate NFL average for drives:\n",

    "Generally speaking this doesn't feel representative of the actual NFL experience since it only takes into account static general probabilities and is not team to team, home or away advantage (it exists, the Denver Broncos are one of many examples of a location advantage MILE HIGH), clutch factor, personel, injuries, etc. This may give a decent overview given what we are given, but the phrase \"any given Sunday\" still rings true, which makes the game less predicable and more interesting as a result. The duration itself is not well represented in this model, which is my biggest problem. More or less, context is extremely important in order to understand the way that teams win. This model does not count for fumbles, interceptions, safeties, strip sacks, muffed punts/kicks, or any other way a turnover can occur. It is totally possible for a possession to be literally a second (the Broncos' first possession against the Seahawks in the SB was about 0.7 seconds or the time it took for the center to hike that ball over the forehead of Peyton Manning) but the context, position on the field, turnover or not, all play a big factor in win chance. Possessions should not follow the same distributions as during the game, especially in terms of the regular season. The regular season and the playoffs are completely different, arbitrarily following that average makes no sense and shoud not interfere with overtime, which is a completely differet game. For fear of writing an essay, all I will say is that number of possessions should not play a significant role in one team beating other in overtime. That's left for regulation, overtime is special because of how it is formatted, a \"all in\" one shot type of situation. And also, whether or not it is fair isn't up to the NFL, 30 people need to watch Young Sheldon after so the game has to end in a timely manner rather then a fair one "
