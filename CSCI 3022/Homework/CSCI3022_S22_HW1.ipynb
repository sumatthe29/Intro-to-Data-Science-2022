    "- Any relevant data sets should be available on Canvas. To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Here is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.  I also recommend the [wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) for LaTex.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do **Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All** as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- 45 points of this assignment are in problems.  The remaining 5 are for neatness, style, and overall exposition of both code and text.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",
    "- There is *not a prescribed API* for these problems.  You may answer coding questions with whatever syntax or object typing you deem fit.  Your evaluation will primarily live in the clarity of how well you present your final results, so don't skip over any interpretations!  Your code should still be commented and readable to ensure you followed the given course algorithm.\n",
    "- There are two ways to quickly make a .pdf out of this notebook for Gradescope submission.  Either:\n",
    " - Use File -> Download as PDF via LaTeX.  This will require your system path find a working install of a TeX compiler\n",
    " - Easier: Use File ->  Print Preview, and then Right-Click -> Print using your default browser and \"Print to PDF\"\n",

Class 3 passengers most likely had to brave the waters to survive, resulting in significantly lower chances of survival as a general population.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **(ii)** When reviewing gender survival probability, how do the results compare to the base survival probability results from **Part A**?\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Generally speaking, the female rate of survival (f = 0.749) was more than triple the resulting male survival rate (m = 0.197). Looks like the hypothetical cases present in a previous part were more or less what happened in conjunction. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **(iii)** Within each passenger class, were men or women more/less/equally likely to survive?\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Within each passenger class, it was to be expected based on prior comprehensive results that women were significantly more likely to have survived. The highest survival rates for women came from classes 1 and 2 (c1w = 0.960, c2w = 0.931) with class 3 women also having noticably higher survival rates (c3w = 0.525) then even the class 1 men (c1m = 0.387) with class 2 and 3 men essentially lost at sea more or less (c2m = 0.184, c3m = 0.138).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **(iv)**  Did men in first class or women in third class have a higher survival probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "a. As mentioned, women in class 3 (c3w = 0.525) had a much higher survival rate then first class men (c1m = 0.387)."

    "**Part E**: One might wonder how a passenger's age is related to the likelihood that they would survive the Titanic disaster. In addition to the \"male chivalry\" argument outlined above, you can perhaps imagine an addendum - \"women and children first!\" - as the cry to ring out across the decks. Or you might imagine the opposite - rather than \"class warfare\", it is simply healthy adults fighting to take lifeboat spots for themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question graphically, plot two density histograms on the *same set* of axes, showing the distribution of the ages of passengers who survived, and the distribution of the ages of passengers who did not.  This means that the two axes should overlap. \n",
    "* Use the bin edges $[0,3,6,\\ldots,75,78,81]$ for both histograms.\n",
    "* To better distinguish between our populations, we will represent survivors with the color arguments `lawngreen` and the passed with `aqua`.\n",
    "* As you plot both histograms on a single set of axes you should use Matplotlib/Pandas plotting functionality to make the faces of the histogram boxes somewhat transparent (`alpha`), so both histograms are visible and their overlap becomes a blend of the two colors.\n",
    "* Include a legend (`plt.legend` after `label=` on the histograms) and label your axes.\n",
    "* Comment on the results. Does your figure suggest that some age ranges are more or less likely to have survived the disaster than other ages? Fully explain your reasoning and use your figure to justify your conclusions.\n",
    "* If you noticed some relationship between age and likelihood of survival, what is one possible explanation?"

    "a. Based on what I can see, those who were on the younger side of 30 and older than 18-20 managed to have a better chance at surviving. This can be attributed to healthier, stronger, and preservation of younger life versus those who were older and died because of their age, physical shape, or relinquish their spot in favor of others. Children under the age of 10 also showed decent survivability compared to other age ranges as many probably gave up their young to someone on a lifeboat, but that sample size is smaller due to less babies and toddlers being on board to begin with. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you noticed some relationship between age and likelihood of survival, what is one possible explanation?\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Generally preservation of younger healthier individuals in their prime would affect likelyhood of survival. Those who could be carried such as babies or toddlers could also be handed over and taken on a boat with little resistance. Priotizing those in certain parts of their lives as a group effort would help your survival chances. "

We witnessed that those who were female were prioritized the most out of gender, with even class 3 women having a higher survival rate then even class 1 men. We also saw that those in class 1 and 2 had higher survival rates then those in class 3, representing a large majority of those who survived in general. This is most likely due to the percieved importance those people may have had over others as well, whereas class 3 passengers were more or less cargo to begin with. Finally, passangers were definitly prioritized based on age, as those who could literally live more life were prioritized over those who were already past their primes. We can see that a group effort was made to essentialy get what society deemed the most important demographic makeup passengers off before anyone else. "
