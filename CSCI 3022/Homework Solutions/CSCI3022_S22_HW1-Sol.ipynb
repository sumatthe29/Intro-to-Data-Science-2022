Here is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.  I also recommend the [wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) for LaTex.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do **Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All** as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- 45 points of this assignment are in problems.  The remaining 5 are for neatness, style, and overall exposition of both code and text.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",
    "- There is *not a prescribed API* for these problems.  You may answer coding questions with whatever syntax or object typing you deem fit.  Your evaluation will primarily live in the clarity of how well you present your final results, so don't skip over any interpretations!  Your code should still be commented and readable to ensure you followed the given course algorithm.\n",
    "- There are two ways to quickly make a .pdf out of this notebook for Gradescope submission.  Either:\n",
    " - Use File -> Download as PDF via LaTeX.  This will require your system path find a working install of a TeX compiler\n",

    "**EXAMPLE**\n",
    "It is always **very** difficult to attempt to draw *casual* statements out of data.  It is certainly clear that, all else being equal, you were more likely to survive as a woman.  You were also more likely to survive as a higher-class passenger.  It also appears that people ages 16-28 survived at a slightly greater rate than they died at.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why?  The man/woman split might appear that the men were being chivalrous and making sure that the women got off the boat first... or perhaps that was the pre-written policy of White Star, and it was simply the rules rather than chivalry.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the first class folks were far more likely to survive. Is this because the rich forced the poor out of boats, or that higher-priced cabins tend to be much higher up and closer to the deck of the ship, allowing much quicker access to escape route?  Given our data, we can never know for sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw some sort of age bias in survival for the \"young adults\", which could be due to a conscious attempt or it could be due to a simple healthiness effect (children and older folks may not have been able to handle the arctic waters). It could be a mix of all of these factors. However, it is also entirely possible that we need more information.  The best we can do here is describe patterns, and mere speculate as to what created those patterns."

Since it doesn't try to stratify according to passenger class (and is also subject to randomness), we see a variety of subsamples ranging from 10% survival to 75% survival.  As a whole though, the subsamples have a mean survival rate of 39.3%, close to that of the larger data frame of 39.2%.  This is very good, and something we'll talk about a lot in this class: often smaller samples still retain the overall properties of the whole, so a group of 20 passengers might be \"good enough\" to estimate what happens to the larger population!"
