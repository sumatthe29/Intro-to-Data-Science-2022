Here is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.

    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do **Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All** as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",

    "- 45 points of this assignment are in problems.  The remaining 5 are for neatness, style, and overall exposition of both code and text.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",
    "- There is *not a prescribed API* for these problems.  You may answer coding questions with whatever syntax or object typing you deem fit.  Your evaluation will primarily live in the clarity of how well you present your final results, so don't skip over any interpretations!  Your code should still be commented and readable to ensure you followed the given course algorithm.\n",
    "- There are two ways to quickly make a .pdf out of this notebook for Gradescope submission.  Either:\n",
    " - Use File -> Download as PDF via LaTeX.  This will require your system path find a working install of a TeX compiler\n",

    "Hopefully you enjoyed the Super Bowl, which (again) this year tragically did not involve the Detroit Lions.  One narrative that is often discussed in the NFL playoffs is whether or not overtime - the way games tied after 4 quarters are handled -  is *fair*.  The general rules of an NFL overtime are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The teams alternate who gets the ball to try to score.  The team that wins the coin toss gets to try first.\n",
    "- The game is over whenever a team scores, and that team is the winner.  There are two exceptions to this rule, listed in the next bullet point.\n",
    "- If the first team (Team 0) scores a \"Field Goal,\" the other team has a chance to get the ball.  In this case, if the other team (Team 1) scores a \"Touchdown\" they win, if Team 1 scores a \"Field Goal,\" the game continues but reverts to next-score-wins, and if Team 1 failes to score they lose.\n",
    "- The game ends at a tie (in the regular season) if neither team scores at all within 10 minutes.  The game is also a tie if they each scored Field Goals in their first drives and then no scores followed in an overall duration of 10 minutes.  It's also possible for Team 0 to win by scoring a Field Goal and having the clock run out during Team 1's subsequent drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to *simulate* NFL overtimes to determine whether or not they're fair!  Note that in theory this **should** be a similar to problem 1: if $p=q=.5$ in the dueling problem, you should be able to quickly compute that both Dale and Brennan would be equally likely to win.  But the NFL rules are a little different, and not every scenario involves both teams getting an equal number of chances...\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate NFL overtimes, we're going to simulate **drives** of each team.  These is the outcomes of each of their turns to have the ball.  In particular, we'll assume each and every drive follows the (simplified) probabilities given by the approximate NFL average for drives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A drive has 30% chance to end in a Touchdown.\n",
    "- A drive has 1/6 chance to end in a Field Goal.\n",
