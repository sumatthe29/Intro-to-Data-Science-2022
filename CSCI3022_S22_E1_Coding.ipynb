    "This exam coding segment is due on Canvas by **11:59 PM on Friday March 18*. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the rules:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. All work, code and analysis, must be your own. \n",
    "2. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbooks, in-class notebooks, and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions like the form of a probability distribution function or how to perform a particular operation in Python/Pandas. \n",
    "3. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your midterm exam. So, the instructional team will be a bit less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, significantly debug your code, and so on.  But please don't feel like you're totally alone on this: feel free to ask questions or ask for help, and we will decide how best to provide that assistance.\n",
    "4. If something is left open-ended, it is because we want to see how you approach the kinds of problems you will encounter in the wild, where it will not always be clear what sort of tests/methods should be applied. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "5. You may **NOT** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "6. You may **NOT** copy-paste solutions *from anywhere*.\n",
    "7. You may **NOT** collaborate with classmates or anyone else.\n",
    "8. In short, **your work must be your own**. It really is that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of the above rules will result in an immediate academic sanction (*at the very least*, you will receive a 0 on this exam coding assignment or an F in the course, depending on severity), and a trip to the Honor Code Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By submitting this assignment, you agree to abide by the rules given above.**\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTES**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- You may not use late days on the exam coding nor can you drop your exam coding grades. \n",
    "- If you have a question for us, post it as a **PRIVATE** message on Piazza.  If we decide that the question is appropriate for the entire class, then we will add it to a exam coding clarifications thread. (NB: you should use public posts for the epidemiology \"warmup\" prompts).\n",
    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. The exam coding assignmnet is designed to be completed using only the packages in the first given code cell.\n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- This should go without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit.\n",
    "- There is *not a prescribed API* for these problems.  You may answer coding questions with whatever syntax or object typing you deem fit.  Your evaluation will primarily live in the clarity of how well you present your final results, so don't skip over any interpretations!  Your code should still be commented and readable to ensure you followed the given course algorithm.\n",
    "- There are two ways to quickly make a .pdf out of this notebook for Gradescope submission.  Either:\n",
    " - Use File -> Download as PDF via LaTeX.  This will require your system path find a working install of a TeX compiler\n",
    " - Easier: Use File ->  Print Preview, and then Right-Click -> Print using your default browser and \"Print to PDF\"\n",
